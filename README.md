# Infinity

Infinity is a web-based IDE for general programming languages.
Infinity is started on a local server, and any developer that wishes
to synchronously interact with other developers on the same project
can simply connect to the local server in the browser.

Infinity is designed to be as dynamic as possible in order to 
anticipate future trends in programming.
